 A library for c++2a standard on gnu/linux.

## Why did I make this?

 I was working on another project when I came to the realization that gnu/g++12 doesn't support some of the things that msvc does when it comes to c++2a.
 So I thought about making my own namespace with some of the things I needed and called it a day.

 *Reminder, this shouldn't be used as a dependency it is highly unstable and I have not tested it yet.*

## TODO
 I'm hoping on making things like ```flat_map```, ```flat_set```, and a lot of the ```ranges::``` functions available to c++2a & 23 developers.
